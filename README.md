My SQL learning path using Practical SQL by Anthony DeBarros &amp; Python Programming in Context by Miller, et. al.
# Data Skills Path Journey 🚀

**From teaching math to building Data & AI applications — documenting every step.**

## 👋 About Me

I'm Dr. Seni — a mathematics educator with a Ph.D. in Mathematics Education and Statistics and 15+ years of teaching experience. I believe there are no "non-math people," only untapped potential.

Now I'm channeling that same philosophy into my own learning journey: transitioning into Data & AI Engineering by mastering the tools of the trade.

## 🎯 The Goal

**Become proficient in SQL and Python by March 2026** — then continue building toward AI Engineering.

This repo is my "learning in public" commitment. Every query, every script, every mistake — documented.
